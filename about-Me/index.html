        </p>
        
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of Hobbies I find learning and improving on new skills quite fun.
            Some of the skills I have learnt and am currently learning are listed further down.<br>
            and when im not learning new skills I like to be playing video games or driving.<br>
            I find driving arround quite excitiing and one day hope to have every class of Licence available in New Zealand, so far I have class 1(car) and 6(motorbike) Licences.
        </p>

        <h3>Computer Science and Electronics</h3>
        <p>
            I know how to make games and websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript, and I plan on learning how to make games with Unreal Engine.
            I also know how to code in some very basic Python.
            Previously I've made some projects using an Arduino Uno's and an Esp32's and I will continue to make Arduino projects in my spare time.
            If you would like to see any of my projects head over to my <a class="link" href="/projects/">Projects Page</a>.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Photography and Videography</h3>
        <p>
            A few years ago I started to experiment with taking Photos. I started on my phone camera and now I have a Canon R50 with the basic kit lens.<br>
            I love taking mainly landscape and nature photos, recently I bought a drone and wish to get into areial photography and a bit of videography.<br>
            I've also recently started to post the photos that I take on my Photography website which you can find <a class="link" href="https://photography.johaan.org" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Home-Lab</h3>
        <p>
            I have a small home-lab setup in my parents garage with a 2 computers runing as servers.
            One of the servers is running as a Proxmox server and the other as a TrueNAS server.
            These both have variuos virtual machines and containers runing on them for different purposes.
            If you would like to know more about my home-lab setup you can read all about it <a class="link" href="/projects/homelab.html">here</a>.
