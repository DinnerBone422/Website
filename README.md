# Website
Hi there! My name is Johaan and welcome to my website.<br>
This site started out as a playground where I experiment and learn HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.
On here you can find some of the projects that I've worked on like games, more websites, arduino projects and more.
If you're interested in checking them out, feel free to visit my <a class="link" href="/projects/">Projects Page</a> or head over to my <a class="link" href="https://github.com/dinnerbone422" target="_blank">GitHub Page</a> where I'm currently working on some new projects that haven't been posted on this website yet.
If you want to know more about me, you can also visit my <a class="link" href="/about-Me/">About Me Page</a>.
and to follow my photography and videography journey, check out my <a class="link" href="https://photography.johaan.org" target="_blank">photography website</a>!<br><br>
Thanks for dropping by and I hope you enjoy exploring the rest of the site!
