# Website
Hi there! My name is Johaan and welcome to my website.
This site is basically just my playground where I get to explore and learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I also share some of the games and other projects that I've created. If you're interested in checking them out, feel free to visit my Projects Page or head over to my GitHub Page where I'm currently working on some new projects. If you want to know more about me, you can also visit my About Me Page.
Thanks for dropping by and I hope you enjoy exploring the site!
